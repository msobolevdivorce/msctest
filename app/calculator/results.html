        <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> This calculator performs very <i>simple and basic</i> child and spousal support calculations under Canadian federal law based on limited information provided by the user. <b>This calculator is intended to provide a starting point or “ballpark” figure</b>, to be adjusted in accordance with the many other factors not considered by this calculator that could dramatically affect these results. This is not legal advice; parties are strongly advised to seek the advice of a family lawyer. <b>Some lawyers offer “unbundled” legal services to assist you with a specific part of your case only, such as: preparing a detailed support calculation and analysis; reviewing or preparing court materials; attending at a court appearance; etc. This can be a cost-effective way of obtaining legal assistance when needed.</b>
